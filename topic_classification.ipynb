The English game has really lost its identity as years have gone on and it's now so plastic a competition that it has become painfully dull to watch. It lacks that raw passion smaller leagues still have. So that's why I cringe at how a lot of Americans would rather support teams in a whole different continent, instead of showing passion for your own teams.\n",

I'd be curious to know what Samoa Joe's opinion is. That's a guy pretty well regarded as having the smarts to put together a solid match, and his most influential match was probably that weird faux-MMA thing he did with Angle years ago. It looked like a bold new direction for pro wrestling at the time, and if anything, the industry has taken a sharp turn AWAY from that type of presentation. That alone certainly gives Angle a perspective that is pretty unique among WWE producers - at least the ones I know of - and even if that isn't the right role for him, I'm glad he's getting some dough to pad his nest egg for a few years.

I realize that just because I'm liquid cooling, the amount of heat being generated by my CPU doesn't change, but what does change is the way I'm dealing with that heat. With a massive heatsink + 140mm fan, it was always just pushing all of that hot air directly out of the back and top of the case.  With liquid, the heat is transferred to the front radiator where it is dissipated. The difference is the heat is dissipated at the front of the case, where the intake fans pull cool air over the radiator. The warm air coming off the radiator, for the most part is now exhausting out of the top of the case instead of the back. \n",

My point is if you’ve been playing since release and your still that bad then maybe you should try and follow the ones who are good to learn from them. Hiding in a corner while I take down 2/3 people in a squad and really hurt the 3rd isn’t going to make you a better player. You learn by picking fights and getting kills, dropping to those busy areas, actually shooting your gun and supporting your teammates in a heavily team oriented game. You want to get good then listen to those people who have 300 wins cuz if they have that many wins and kills then they obviously are doing something right.

Stepping back and seeing how they react to pressure is important before going in again to either condition them or mix them up.

I love it, but even I’m kind of getting jaded by the repetitive gameplay and lack of things to work towards. It’s a wonderful game, but where they made an error perhaps was in the lack of providing anything substantial to look forward to as you level up. There’s no staying power, nothing worth working towards, you can’t even customize your character without spending real money as you don’t get enough ingame currency to blow. There’s nothing rewarding except for that you might encounter some cool randoms, or the fun of surviving an initial skirmish. No other modes to kill the boredom (capture the flag, protect the vip etc) and who cares about weapon skins or alternate voice openings, well maybe the teen or younger demographic but certainly not someone like myself.  I feel one new character really isn’t going to make much impact at this point to keep most of us playing.

Bran's trap is multi-layered, he has heavy archer coverage with both dragon glass and valyrian arrows in case NK shows.

From the edges of the darkness, giants lumber forward.  There are white walkers, commanding.  Taking one out deletes a portion of the dead army, and they become high priority but difficult targets.  A Dothraki flanking charge destroys one.  Tyrion catches on and signals the Dragons to focus WWs.  NK shows up to defend his WW, aerial combat ensues.  \n",

Dead are spilling over the walls in places, attacking archers.  Edd moves to relieve the archers but many still go down.  Arya shatters her bow defending herself and ultimately is saved by Beric, who dies.  Tyrion is calling for Dothraki to charge the front to relieve pressure from the gate troops, but NK has wounded Drogon and he's down.  Drogon is thrashing and breathing fire everywhere but still getting swarmed and Jorah sees this and disobeys orders to save his Khaleesi.  He dies.  Tormund takes a giant or two down, and died.  There is still a 3rd, the living retreat inside from the front except for the cluster around Dany.  Jon is trying to keep Dany and Drogon alive with air support, and the NK slips off to the godswood.  Jaime and some troops make it into the gates but Brienne dies protecting the retreat.

Bran is in the weirwood net, and he finds Arya and tells her to go for the heart.  She understands, and she turns and screams to the Hound \"get me to the godswood!\"  Jon realizes what is going on and he abandons Dany and the Dothraki to fight, blasts the godswood with dragonsfire as NK is about to kill Bran.  More WWs die and more undead shatter but the NK still stands and his swing follows through.  Three-Eyed Raven is dead.  The Hound and Arya are fighting their way through, the gate is almost smashed.  Mellisandre prays to her god and it seems that the whole fucking world except Winterfell itself is lit on fire, though it is actually just a perimeter around the castle that does not incinerate the Dothraki.  They've been bought a little time from the flood of dead, but there is still a clock.  The Hound, his troops, and Arya make it to the godswood but everything is on fire and he can't deal.  He's back against a wall and he's just fucking crying and watching.  Arya throws a dragonglass dagger at Viseryon and destroys him, prevent NK escape.  NK is getting reinforced desperately, even through the perimeter flames.  The troops fight to push towards NK, Arya is trying to find her opening and stay alive, the Hound has to get his shit together and save her, tears and all, and she makes her jump over a bunch of dead and does her cool dagger trick and saves the day.  \n",

The Pokemon Movie is a good example I think of how the process should be done properly, most people were originally a bit put off by the designs realism but I think for the most part have grow accustomed to the designs because they are still fairly faithful the the characters.  Sonic though I don't think is going to be well received in terms of design... probably ever.  Changing stuff to be realistic is allrgiht with this type of movie, but they didn't really even stay that true to the character.

As I said, the constitution does not prohibit felon's from voting.  The constitution also does not specifically enumerate the right to vote.  The constitution places constitutional limitations on the implied right to vote (not express), in that the state cannot discriminate against certain groups from voting.  However, felon disenfranchisement has always been allowed under scotus review, as there are compelling interests to take away felon's right to vote.  Regardless, the right is not a specifically enumerated right under the constitution, and moreover, the government has the right to disenfranchise felon's from voting.  The case law has been pretty clear on this issue.  See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418 U.S. 24 (1974).\n",

            "The one thing I wanna know, though, that I can't seem to find the answer to anywhere on the internet, is whether Hemsworth actually put on that weight, or if it was CGI. I mean on the one hand, Hemsworth has transformed his body before, I mean he was skinny as hell before he booked Thor, and then he got really really skinny for that Ron Howard whale movie. And the look of him with his shirt off, just the way the weight was distributed, reminded me a lot of when other normally fit or muscular actors have put on weight quickly for a role, like Christian Bale in American Hustle or Mac from that one season of It's Always Sunny. There's like a very particular method for just bloating yourself like that, and that looked like what he had done to his body. It also looked considerably less fake than when they had the CGI skinny Robert Downey Jr. at the beginning. Then again, this is an Avengers movie. It's the kind of thing where things you don't even think about are CGI. We see Chris Evans' face CGIed onto an old man at the end and it's seamless. Not to mention, we never saw any sign of Chris Hemsworth out in public sporting any extra weight. So I don't know, it really wouldn't surprise me either way. Does anyone know?\n",

However, despite the recognition of the genocidal character of the massacre of Armenians in scholarship as well as in civil society, some governments have been reticent to officially acknowledge the killings as genocide because of political concerns about their relations with the Republic of Turkey, the successor state of the Ottoman Imperial authorities which perpetrated the genocide. The governments of Turkey and its close ally The Republic of Azerbaijan are the only ones that directly deny the historical factuality of the Armenian Genocide, and both are adamantly opposed to the recognition of the genocide by other nations, threatening economic and diplomatic consequences to recognizers.\n",

We grew up with the threat of a nuclear bomb and the aids epidemic, but after 9/11 occurred, it felt like we were living in an alternate reality and I don’t think I’ve ever recovered from that feeling. My husband and I moved to NYC a year or so after 9/11 for a job. I remember various things happening that seemed to intensify/reinforce the fear like low flying helicopters nightly, the blackout, occasional terror threats, and I think there was some explosion at a Staten island power plant at one point. Even the 2004 tsunami, a few years later, seemed to add to the trauma. Something else I noticed is that people seemed to become more “religious” and a lot of mega churches popped up. It was also a time when people were more willing to accept the federal government using that fear to do things that previously seemed like a major overstepping of privacy. I read The Shock Doctrine, by Naomi Kline and thought it had a lot of good insights. And here we are.\n",

This is so that people don't feel bad about the system and stop playing ranked because they're afraid to drop and lose out on rewards. It also means that boosted players can only pay for 1 boost to guarantee the rewards for the season and are then free to drop down to where they belong faster.

            "Something that has bothered me is that the wardrobe and makeup teams have been getting a lot of praise and awards as the show has gone on, yet as the show has gone on, the makeup and wardrobes have gotten more unrealistic. It does not accurately depict that world anymore. Think back to season 1 when people actually looked like medieval times. They had plain clothes (even highborn wore fairly simple clothes) and messy hair/no makeup. Dany’s hair wasn’t perfectly in place. Cersei arrived at WF and it really did look like she had been on the road for the past 30 days. Now look at things in WF. Sansa and Arya have loads of makeup on and new finely detailed outfits for our characters. Where did they find the time to do all this. Aren’t there more pressing matters to focus on than making sure you look dope? They also stopped making the characters wear useful armor. Gone are the days of chainmail and steel plates. The show USED to feel so REAL and believable.\n",

However, if there IS a connection from the Three-Eyed Crow to the Faceless Men, then we know the role of the Great Other is as the many-faced god of death. Death and destruction may be his sole motivation. \n",

            "This idea of a faceless, cosmic being interested only in chaos would be a very close fit for the Lovecraftian mythology entity known as Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos. In fact, in one reference, Nyarlathotep is said to be \"a faceless god in the caverns of Earth's center\". In the books, we know that the story of the Faceless Men begins in the mines of Valyria. If this wasn't compelling enough, the reference I posted to the World book regarding the Long Night of Yi Ti directly mentions the Church of Starry Wisdom. This is a DIRECT reference, word-for-word with no change, to the [Church of Starry Wisdom  from the expanded Lovecraft universe](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Church_of_Starry_Wisdom), a cult dedicated to Nyarlathotep, in this instance known as the Haunter in the Dark. In that story, the cult uses a black stone, the Shining Trapazohedron, to communicate with and summon Nyarlathotep. The ending sees the protagonist throw the Shining Trapazohedron into a deep body of water, hoping to rid the world of the entity forever. What he doesn't realize is that the darkness at the bottom allows his perpetual freedom. Now if this sounds a lot like glass candles and possibly the God's Eye (a deep body of water where even entire dragon corpses have disappeared), then we might have a lot in common with the motivations of the 3EC. The Isle of Faces and/or God's Eye may have something essential that would allow him even more power to openly affect our world or maybe even time itself. \n",

            "Alternatively, if you want a more grounded possibility, we know that the Last Greenseer represents the collective consciousness of the Children of the Forest. We're intended to believe that the Children created the Night King, then later regretted their decision as the Night King turned on them. However, if the Night King IS only interested in death...what about Craster? Why was he spared as long as he kept sacrificing? I'll tell you why: Because mankind didn't side with the Children to defeat the White Walkers...They struck a bargain with the White Walkers AGAINST the Children. There's a ton of theories out there giving very good evidence that the early men and Night's Watch sacrificed to the Others (particularly with the magic gate at the Nightfort). It would also explain why the wall exists: Because the White Walkers BUILT it for humanity. As the collective consciousness of the Children of the Forest, the Three-Eyed Crow wants REVENGE. It wants its land back. It wants to destroy the things that pushed them to the brink of extinction. And GRRM HAS used a physically underpowered race being responsible for inciting war through visions and subversive means before in his stories.\n",

The collodion is poured onto a piece of metal (think of it as a film) and then is put in a silver nitrate tank for a few minutes to make the plate light sensitive. After that, it is pulled out and put into a plate holder. I then take the plate holder to my camera, focus my camera then load the plate holder into it. That's when I take an exposure. After that I have to develop it on site while the plate is still wet in my portable darkroom. Think of this process as creating a Polaroid 1850s style.\n",

The only reason this doesn't seem to be the case in GoT is because most of the castles in the show are poorly located, designed and defended, but this is to be expected from a TV show. Castle Black, in particular, is a joke considering how old and important it's supposed to be, but perhaps it's in such a pitiful state because the Night's Watch were neglected for decades and are in decline.

This is why, historically, attackers went to the considerable effort of building siege equipment, even when they had a significant numerical advantage.\n",

            "Thirdly, the defenders don't know they're doomed and even if they suspect it, they can't assume the battle is a lost cause, because if they do, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy (aka a fait accompli). Morale may be irrelevant to the army of the dead but it's paramount to the defenders of Winterfell. The best way for the heroes to instill confidence in their troops is to formulate the best plan they can, execute it to the best of their ability, lead by example from the front and hope this is enough. Indeed, making it as difficult as possible for the army of the dead to take Winterfell would force the Night King to personally intervene with Viserion, providing Jon and Dany with a chance to take him out, which was their plan anyway.\n",

Lot of murderers have killed their female partners in a rage; so they've got a 'chip-on-the-shoulder' (i.e woman haters too). Little known fact is around HALF the inmate population these days are guys who've breached 'domestic violence court orders'. Send yr female ex an angry text message: 3 months gaol.
